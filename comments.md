Comments / Questions

- The login card is too small, and the title at the top is not visible. Please fix the layout and make it clearly visible.
- Why is the login page still the only progress you have made so far?

Tasks to Do

- Install JSON Server for mock data.
- Install SweetAlert for login and logout notifications.
- Install PrimeNG for UI components and icons.
- On my next system check, the users data must already be stored in the JSON Server.
- If there is still no progress until March 4, you will fail the midterm.
